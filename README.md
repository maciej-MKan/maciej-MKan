## Hi, I'm Maciej.

<h3><i> I don't know why you came here, but you must know something about me.
There are 2 loves in my life (except my wife of course</i> 😚<i>). Electronics and programming. For the last several years I have led the life of an electronics engineer, but the time has come for a change of mistress. In 2021, I decided to become a professional backend developer. Therefore, I started learning Python and Java along with their popular frameworks. What you see here is the fruit of that science. Enjoy and comment if you like</i> 😁 <i>. </h3> </i>
