## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

<h3><i>I'm a passionate programmer who loves solving problems and creating efficient solutions. My primary focus is Java, but I also have experience working with TypeScript, Python, and other tools that help bring ideas to life. Programming isn't just my professionâ€”it's my true passion.

Here on my profile, you'll find projects that showcase my journey in mastering these technologies. Iâ€™m constantly learning, improving, and striving to write clean, maintainable code.

Feel free to explore my work and leave a comment if something catches your eye. Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜Š</i></h3>
