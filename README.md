## Hi, I'm Maciej.

<h3><i> Welcome to my profile! Let me tell you a bit about myself. There are two passions in my life (aside from my wife, of course üòö): electronics and programming. For the last several years, I've been working as an electronics engineer, but in 2021, I decided to transition to a new challenge and become a professional backend developer.

I am a dedicated and ambitious programmer with a strong focus on Java, which is my primary language. I also have experience working with Python and JavaScript/TypeScript, along with their popular frameworks. What you see here is the result of my hard work and dedication to mastering these technologies.

Feel free to explore my projects, and don't hesitate to leave a comment if you like what you see üòÅ.</i></h3>
